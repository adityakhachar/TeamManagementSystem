## Usage

To get the project up and running, follow these steps:

### Starting the Frontend

1. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```
    This will launch the frontend on `http://localhost:3000`.

    cd backend
    ```

2. Install the necessary backend dependencies:
    ```bash

- The backend server must be running for the frontend application to communicate with it.
- If you encounter any issues, check the console for error messages and ensure all dependencies are correctly installed.
